webdriver-with-gradle
=====================

This is a framework I created for Selenium with gradle. The framework uses the page object pattern and the tests are influenced by the fluent interface. I have used the fluentlenium framework for user interactions. The framework is quite barebones at the moment.

The tests aren't working yet. I will update the readme as soon as i get it working.
